## get started

Unzip the cs-script utility *.7z files inside the lib directory (or install the latest version from [cs-script](https://github.com/oleg-shilo/cs-script/releases)).
  - Read about cs-script on the [wiki](https://github.com/oleg-shilo/cs-script/wiki) and read the [docs](http://www.csscript.net/help/Online/) to learn about this awesome tool
  - You could use [LINQPad](https://www.linqpad.net/) or [scriptcs](http://scriptcs.net/) as well (leaving that up to you to convert 'codegen.cs')

Once you have either installed cs-script or unzipped it, you can run the '[codegen.cs](codegen.cs)' command from the command prompt:

```
lib\cs-script\cscs.exe .\codegen.cs -help
```
